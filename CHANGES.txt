TODO: List here all the changes you made to given template to adapt it to your needs
1 - Took out the trusted companies because that doesn't make sense to my website of being a developer without a reputation.
2 - Got rid of the logo up top, as I didn't like it and it wasn't the right color. Getting rid of it also helped simplify this website.
3 - Got rid of most of the footer containers where only the copyright is shown. It had a lot of unneccessary content.
